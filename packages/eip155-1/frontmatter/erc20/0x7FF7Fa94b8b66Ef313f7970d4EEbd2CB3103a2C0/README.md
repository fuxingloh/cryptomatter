# Vana

Vana is an EVM-compatible Layer 1 blockchain network that enables users to transform personal data into financial assets by aggregating private datasets for AI model training. This approach allows individuals to tokenize and monetize their data through Data Decentralized Autonomous Organizations (Data DAOs), granting them ownership and control over their digital footprints.
