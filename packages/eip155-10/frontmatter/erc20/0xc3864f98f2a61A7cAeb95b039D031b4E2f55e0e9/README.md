# OpenX Optimism

OpenXSwapâ€™s native token, OpenX, provides the foundation for the exchange. Liquidity Providers receive it in exchange for participating in Active Yield Generating Pools. These pools are intended to generate transaction fees then used to buy back and burn OpenX, offsetting its emissions.
