# Starknet

StarkNet is a permissionless decentralized Validity-Rollup (also known as a “ZK-Rollup”). It operates as an L2 network over Ethereum, enabling any dApp to its computation – without compromising Ethereum’s composability and security, thanks to StarkNet’s cryptographic proof system – STARK.
