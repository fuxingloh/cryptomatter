# BUSD Token

BUSD is issued on Ethereum by Paxos and regulated by the NYDFS. Binance provides the pegged token service, which locks BUSD on Ethereum and issues an equivalent amount of Binance-Peg BUSD on corresponding other networks (BNB Chain, Avalanche and Polygon, TRON etc). Please note that Binance-Peg BUSD is a Binance product. It is not issued by Paxos nor regulated by the NYDFS.
