# Based ETH

Reserve is a free, permissionless platform to build, deploy and govern asset-backed currencies referred to as RTokens. RTokens are always 1:1 asset-backed, allowing for permissionless minting and redeeming. Based ETH is an RToken that maintains an Ethereum-aligned Liquid Staking Token basket.
