# Balancer

Balancer is a n-dimensional automated market-maker that allows anyone to create or add liquidity to customizable pools and earn trading fees. Instead of the traditional constant product AMM model, Balancerâ€™s formula is a generalization that allows any number of tokens in any weights or trading fees.
